    <h2>Walkthrough</h2>
    <p>
      The walkthrough feature shows you around the application automatically. You can start the walkthrough by either clicking on the "View the Walkthrough" button on the beginning search page, or by clicking on the <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px; line-height: 14px;">?</span> symbol in the bottom left of the application. The symbol will start the walkthrough from whichever page you are currently on.
    </p>
    <h2>Reset Buttons</h2>
    <p>There are multiple reset buttons throughout the application. The reset button on the navigation sidebar will reset all changes made to the application. The reset buttons that show up next to the titles of each page will reset all the data on that specific page. The Customize - Quality of Life and Services pages both have reset buttons inside the cards. These will only reset the specific card you are looking at.</p>

    <h2>Load Custom Service Metrics</h2>
    <p>The Scenario Builder page has a Load Custom Service Metrics button next to its reset button. This will load in any data you had customized on the Customize Data pages and apply it to the Scenario Builder. Normally, these pages can be customized separately.</p>

    <h2>File / settings menu</h2>
    <p>
      The File menu contains the options to open and save community data. The save feature allows you to save your customizations as a .JSON file, and the load feature lets you load in a previously saved .JSON file.<br>
      The Settings menu contains the options to toggle the search method or show the DISC description. The search method option will change the text-based search bars to drop down menus. The "Show DISC description" option will re-enable the popup that appears when opening the application for the first time, if the "don't show this message again" checkbox was selected. You will need to restart the application after clicking this option in order to see the popup again.
